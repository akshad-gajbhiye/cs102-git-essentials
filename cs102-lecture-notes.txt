Summary of Todays Class:
Today we first learnt about github desktop. It is a very convenient way with better gui for the user. After that we learnt about markdown and Html.
We also got to know that wikipedia is made in markdown language. Markdown is a lightweight markup language for creating formatted text using a plain-text editor.
Markdown is widely used in blogging, instant messaging, online forums, collaborative software, documentation pages, and readme files.
We also got to knew about how we switched from markdown to html.
